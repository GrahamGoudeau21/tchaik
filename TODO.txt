TODO List
=========

Audio
* Gapless playback (preload next track in playlist, WebAudio API).
* Fix "clicking" on pause/volume (Chrome only, WebAudio API).
* Fadeout on pause/stop (click on Chrome still persists, WebAudio API).

Indexing
* Push auto-complete prefixes to the front-end
* Remove "Composer: Piece name" prefixes (before the current prefix grouper).

UI
* Playlists
  - automatically consecutive merge groups
  - allow repeat on tracks and playlists
  - save/load playlists
  - "recent played" playlist
