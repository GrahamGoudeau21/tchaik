TODO List
=========

Sound (move to WebAudio API)
* Gapless playback (preload next track in playlist, WebAudio API).
* Fix "clicking" on pause/volume (Chrome only, WebAudio API).
* Fadeout on pause/stop (click on Chrome still persists, WebAudio API).

Storage
* Abstract out the storage access.
* S3 storage and fetcher using encrytion (client side) - maybe just use camlistore for this?
* Artwork pre-processing?
* Identification of files (excluding metadata changes, so the actual sound data).

Indexing
* Improve search to order items correctly, could be React not properly rendering things.
* Push auto-complete prefixes to the front-end
* Remove "Composer: Piece name" prefixes (before the current prefix grouper).

UI
* Playlists
  - be able to add individual items to playlists, and have consecutive groups merge
  - remove items when played:
    - mark played items as gray in groups
    - until the whole group has been played and then remove?
  - allow repeat on tracks and playlists
  - save/load playlists
  - "recent played" playlist
  - Expand playlist viewer into a full column if there is the space (or add a main layout option)
